# Contributing

You should only have to modify the files `_docs.md` and `_index.md`.

# Compiling for production

Make sure Markdown ([python dist](http://freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/)) is installed with [codehilite](http://freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/CodeHilite). Then do a:

    ./compile    

That should generate all the necessary production files.
